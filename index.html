        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>La Loteria is like Bingo. The object of the game is to black out  your board. A player wins when they are the first to black out their board. Players must click on the deck of cards that is face-down to select a random card. Players must then check their board to see if the card that was picked matches any of the cards on their board. If the cards match, simply mark it out by clicking on it.</p>
